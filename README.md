| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Radius       | Outer radius of the gear wheel, without the teeth            |
| Hole Radius  | Radius of the hole in the gear wheel                         |
| Thickness    | The thickness of the gear wheel                              |
| Teeth        | The number of teeth the gear wheel has                       |
| Teeth length | How far the teeth extend beyond the radius of the gear wheel |
| Taper        | How much the teeth are tapered                               |
